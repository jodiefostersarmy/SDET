# SDET Assessment

A repo for my answers to the SDET assessment questions.

My choice for programming language will be **Python**.

## File Structure

The structure of this repo is set into two folders; the first is for the test case challenges and the second contains the solutions to the programming challenges.

### Walkthrough

- Folder 1 / Automation Testing
    - A list of tests that could be run for full coverage for a small e-commerce website.

- Folder 2 / Programming Challenges
    - Each solution will contain docstrings to explain the purpose of the function and also the return data type.
